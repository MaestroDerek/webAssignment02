My name is Derek Ledford. I am a Computer Science major at the Rowan University.

# When did it all start?
Growing up, I always knew that I wanted to do something alongside computers. I grew up in the middle of nowhere with no technology; however, when going through school I learned all about computers. Our family purchased our first computer around early 2005, and from here we would use the computer to browse the internet and look at funny videos or pictures. My mother came by once the computer froze and pressed Ctrl+Alt+Del, and I can remember how amazed I was that she was able to do something like this.

### First major
I went to the University of Rio Grande, in Rio Grande Ohio. Here I studied and graduated with my AAS in Network Administration. I knew this wasn't what I wanted to do shortly after moving towards my Bachelor's degree. I debated on changing majors. But to what? I thought.

### Second major
I was offered an internship in New Jersey doing software development for ASRC Federal. From here I really found what I wanted to do with my academic career. Software development. I graduated from RCBC with my AAS in Computer Science, and am currently taking classes at Rowan to complete my Bachelor's of Computer Science.

### Hobbies
I enjoy playing games with friends, as most Computer Science students do. I also love playing music. Growing up, my family put a lot of emphasis on coming together now and again just to play music together. I play the guitar, saxophone, and have played violin in the past; however, I gave up after I left high school.
